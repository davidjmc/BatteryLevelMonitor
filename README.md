# Battery Level Monitor

Energy is a vital resource in IoT because it extends the device lifetime and thus the IoT applications. Still, it is scarce, and therefore monitoring is needed for thinking about strategies for energy-saving. In this sense, this project presents an IoT solution to monitor the charge level of batteries.
